# ebiman
This is a high quality Pac-Man implementation from first principles written
in Go, using the ebiten gaming library. It tries to strike a reasonable
balance between accuracy and understandability. I have included some additional 
features such as an options screen offering various ways to adjust the game's
difficulty and behaviour. Video & audio post-processing filters aim to give a
flavour of playing on real hardware.
## Build & Run
```sh
go build .
./ebiman
```
